Long-term exposure to elevated values can reduce performance and sleep quality.</string>
    <string name="description_text_humidity_absolute">Absolute humidity indicates the actual amount of water vapor in the air, expressed as how many grams of water are contained in one [b]cubic meter (g/m³)[/b] of air. Unlike relative humidity, it does not depend on temperature but represents the total amount of moisture in the air.\n\n[title]Target Range[/title]\n\nThere is no universal target range for absolute humidity. Certain specialized environments such as storage areas, production facilities, and laboratories may require monitoring of absolute humidity. In such cases, specific threshold values are defined for these conditions.\n\n[title]General Actions[/title]\n\nAbsolute humidity is managed using the same principles as relative humidity. In industrial environments, specialized humidifiers or dehumidifiers may also be used.\n\n[title]Effects on Well-being[/title]\n\nControlling absolute humidity is particularly useful in [b]production areas, warehouses, and laboratories[/b] to prevent material degradation or spoilage.\n\n[title]Tips and Additional Information[/title]\n\nAbsolute humidity is not measured directly; it is [b]calculated from the sensor’s temperature and relative humidity readings[/b]. The application automatically computes absolute humidity from the sensor data, so no manual calculations are needed.</string>
    <string name="description_text_humidity_dewpoint">The dew point is the temperature at which [b]water vapor condenses into liquid water[/b] (dew). The unit may be expressed in °C, °F, or K. The dew point helps assess the risk of condensation and understand how moisture behaves indoors.\n\n[title]Target Range[/title]\n\nThere is no general target range for the dew point. To prevent condensation, the dew point temperature should remain lower than the air or surface temperature.\n\n[title]General Actions[/title]\n\nTo lower the dew point temperature, reduce relative humidity or, if possible, increase the temperature of the air or surrounding surfaces.\n\n[title]Effects on Well-being[/title]\n\nCondensation occurs when the air or a surface cools to the dew point temperature or below. This can lead to [b]mold growth, corrosion, and moisture damage[/b].\n\n[title]Tips and Additional Information[/title]\n\nThe dew point provides deeper insight into how moisture behaves than relative humidity alone.</string>
    <string name="description_text_humidity_relative">Relative humidity (RH %) indicates how much moisture the air contains compared to the maximum amount it can hold at a given temperature. Humidity is usually measured as relative humidity (RH %). In the app settings, you can also view absolute humidity or the dew point if desired.\n\n[title]Target Range[/title]\n\n• Living spaces: 30–60 %\n\n[title]General Actions[/title]\n\n[b]If humidity is high (over 60 %)[/b]\n\n• Ventilate rooms, especially when outdoor air is drier (e.g., on cold mornings).\n• Use a range hood and exhaust ventilation during cooking.\n• Keep the bathroom door open and ventilation on after showering.\n• Avoid drying laundry indoors without proper ventilation.\n\n[b]If air is dry (below 30 %)[/b]\n\n• Increase humidity with a humidifier or by placing a bowl of water near a radiator.\n• Check that heating is not set too high.\n• Ensure proper ventilation, but avoid unnecessary drafts.\n\n[title]Effects on Well-being[/title]\n\nStable indoor humidity ([b]around 30–60 %[/b]) makes the air more comfortable and healthier.\n\n• [b]Too humid air[/b] promotes mold and dust mite growth.\n• [b]Too dry air[/b] can dry out skin and irritate the respiratory system.\n\nMaintaining the right humidity level supports health and comfort while preventing damage to structures and materials.\n\n[title]Tips and Additional Information[/title]\n\nIndoor humidity naturally fluctuates depending on the room, season, and time of day.

    <string name="description_text_measurement_sequence_number">The measurement sequence number indicates which measurement sample is being read. This is a [b]technical parameter[/b] that does not need to be monitored in everyday use.\n\n[title]Measurement Purpose[/title]\n\nThe measurement sequence number helps identify possible connection interruptions or device restarts. A steadily increasing number means that measurements are received continuously without gaps. A [b]reset to zero[/b] before the normal cycle ends usually indicates that the device has [b]restarted[/b]. In a RuuviTag sensor, frequent resets typically suggest that the battery is running low. Measurements are incremented every ~2,5 seconds on RuuviTag sensors and every 1 sec on Ruuvi Air.\n\n[title]Tips and Additional Information[/title]\n\n[b]Cycle length:[/b]\n\n• RuuviTag: 0 – 65,534\n• Ruuvi Air: 0 – 16,777,214</string>
    <string name="description_text_movement">The motion counter indicates how many motion events the sensor has detected using its accelerometer.\n\n[title]Measurement Purpose[/title]\n\nThe motion counter helps track whether the sensor has been moved, shifted, or exposed to vibration from its surroundings. The sensor cannot detect motion in the environment like a motion detector would.\n\n[title]Tips and Additional Information[/title]\n\nIf the number of measurements increases without a clear reason, the device may be on an unstable surface or placed somewhere with vibration or other movement energy (e.g., a windowsill, fan, or machine).\n\nThe sensor reads acceleration data 10 times per second. Motion is registered if the acceleration exceeds 0.064 g on any axis. One g equals an acceleration of 9.81 m/s².</string>
    <string name="description_text_nox">The NOx index describes the trend of nitrogen oxides in the air. These harmful gases are produced, for example, by traffic emissions and gas stoves. The NOx index does not show absolute concentrations but indicates a trend — whether the amount of nitrogen oxides has increased or decreased compared to previous levels.\n\n[title]Target Range[/title]\n\nThe index scale ranges from 1–500, with a long-term average fixed at [b]1[/b]. When the NOx index exceeds 1, it means that nitrogen oxides are higher than average in the space.\n\n[title]General Actions[/title]\n\n• [b]Ventilate the room[/b] if NOx values rise. However, consider possible outdoor emissions from traffic or industry.\n• Use a [b]range hood[/b] to remove nitrogen oxides when cooking with a gas stove.\n\nFor example, [b]during cooking or when outdoor pollution increases[/b], the index can rise quickly. The best approach is to monitor the measurements over several days and take note of what happens when values change. This helps identify pollution sources and reduce or eliminate them in the future.\n\n[title]Effects on Well-being[/title]\n\nEven small amounts can [b]irritate the respiratory tract[/b], worsen asthma, and increase susceptibility to infections. Long-term exposure can harm the lungs and the circulatory system.\n\n[title]Tips and Additional Information[/title]\n\nDo not place the sensor directly next to stoves, fireplaces, or ventilation outlets to ensure reliable measurements.</string>
    <string name="description_text_pm">Particulate matter (PM) consists of tiny, invisible particles and impurities suspended in the air.

They can [b]worsen allergies[/b] and cause [b]respiratory symptoms and heart disease[/b]. Concentrations can rise from cooking, burning candles, or outdoor pollution.\n\n[title]Tips and Additional Information[/title]\n\n• Place the sensor away from direct [b]pollution sources[/b] such as stoves or fans.\n• Allow free airflow around the sensor for the most accurate readings.\n• The particle sensor cannot measure pollen or ordinary house dust, as these particles are typically larger than 10 micrometers. It also does not detect mold spores, bacteria, or viruses.\n• The PM2.5 value includes particles with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or smaller. Similarly, PM10 includes particles of 10 µm and smaller.\n• WHO recommendation: [link url=https://www.who.int/teams/environment-climate-change-and-health/air-quality-and-health/health-impacts/types-of-pollutants]https://www.who.int/teams/environment-climate-change-and-health/air-quality-and-health/health-impacts/types-of-pollutants[/link]</string>
    <string name="description_text_pressure">Barometric air pressure indicates the force exerted by the atmosphere on the Earth\'s surface. The selectable units are Pa, hPa, mmHg, or inHg.\n\n[title]Target Range[/title]\n\nAir pressure has no specific target range. The normal pressure at sea level is approximately 1013 hPa.\n\n[title]General Actions[/title]\n\nAtmospheric air pressure and its variations cannot be influenced.\n\n[title]Effects on Well-being[/title]\n\nTrack changes in air pressure to help assess [b]weather variations[/b]. High pressure is often associated with clear weather, while low pressure indicates rain or more humid conditions. Weather changes can affect sensitivity or alertness in some people.\n\n[title]Tips and Additional Information[/title]\n\nKeep in mind that the measured value also depends on the altitude of the measurement location. The sensor value is not compensated for sea level, unlike most weather services, so readings may differ from official reports.</string>
    <string name="description_text_signal_strength">Signal strength (RSSI) indicates the power level of data packets received from the sensor by the mobile device. The closer the value is to zero, the stronger the received signal. This is a [b]technical parameter[/b] that usually does not need to be monitored in everyday use.\n\n[title]Measurement Purpose[/title]\n\nA weak signal can cause connection drops and delays in sensor data updates. You can monitor the signal strength when placing the sensor in a new location. The [b]optimal signal range[/b] is between –80 … 0 dBm. However, note that signal strength continuously fluctuates due to reflections. Different mobile devices may also report slightly different values, so numbers are not always directly comparable.\n\n[title]Tips and Additional Information[/title]\n\n• Signal quality is affected by [b]distance, walls, and other structures, as well as interference from other wireless devices[/b].\n• If the signal is weak, [b]move the sensor[/b] to a location with a clearer line of sight to the receiver. The height of the sensor above the ground can also improve range — higher placement usually results in better signal strength.</string>
