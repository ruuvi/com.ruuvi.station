    <string name="description_text_acceleration">The accelerometer detects whether the device has moved or tilted. It measures changes along three directions (x, y, and z axes), which makes it possible to determine if the device is stationary or in motion.\n\nEarth’s gravity causes about 1 g of acceleration on the axis pointing directly toward the ground.\n\nIf the values remain steady, the device is firmly in place. If the values change, the sensor detects that the device has moved, turned, or tilted. Sudden spikes in the readings indicate rapid movement, while slower changes suggest that the device has gradually tilted or shifted.\n\nIn fixed installations, stable acceleration values confirm that the sensor is securely positioned. In mobile or experimental setups, the values can be used for real-time monitoring of the device’s orientation or vibrations, for example.</string>
    <string name="description_text_air_quality">Air quality is shown with a single index-like number that tells how good or bad the indoor air is. The score is based on two factors: particulate matter (PM2.5) floating in the air, and carbon dioxide (CO₂) that accumulates when people spend time indoors.\n\nThe air quality score takes both factors into account, but if either one rises too much, the overall value decreases. For example, if particle levels increase during cooking, the score will drop even if carbon dioxide is still at a good level.\n\nThe higher the score, the healthier the air is to breathe. Good indoor air supports alertness, concentration, and sleep quality. If the score falls below 70, it may be due to a temporary situation such as poor ventilation or cooking. If it drops below 40, it clearly indicates that fresh air is needed or that there is something indoors that is reducing air quality.\n\nThe easiest way to improve indoor air quality is to ventilate the room by opening windows. Using an air purifier can also help keep the score at a good level.\n\nOptimal result: 90 – 100\nScore scale: 0 – 100</string>
    <string name="description_text_battery_voltage">Battery voltage indicates the condition of the sensor’s battery.\n\nWhen the voltage starts to drop, the battery is running low. This can cause the sensor to measure less accurately or lead to gaps in the data. By monitoring the voltage, you can see in time when the battery needs replacing and avoid sudden device shutdowns.\n\nA new coin cell battery typically starts at about 3 volts. When the value approaches 2.5 volts or lower, the battery is close to empty. If the reading suddenly drops below normal, it may be due to battery aging or cold temperatures reducing its efficiency.\n\nRuuvi Station shows a low battery warning when the voltage falls below a temperature-dependent threshold: 2.0 V at –20 °C, 2.3 V below 0 °C, and 2.5 V at other temperatures.\n\nWe recommend using CR2477 batteries from well-known manufacturers with RuuviTag sensors. The expected battery life under normal conditions is about 1–2 years. Rechargeable batteries are not suitable for use with Ruuvi sensors.\n\nBattery voltage: 3V</string>
    <string name="description_text_co2">Carbon dioxide (CO₂) is produced every time we breathe. If a room has poor ventilation, the level can rise quickly. This may cause tiredness, drowsiness, headaches, and reduced cognitive performance. Cooking, several people staying in the same space, or weak ventilation can also raise CO₂ levels.\n\nOutdoor air normally contains about 420–430 ppm, while indoor levels above 1000 ppm indicate a need for ventilation. In bedrooms, it is best to stay well below this level to maintain good sleep quality.\n\nTo reduce CO₂ levels, set the alarm limit to 1000 so you know when it’s time to ventilate.\n\nOptimal range: 400 – 500\nSensor measurement range: 350 – 40000</string>
    <string name="description_text_humidity_absolute">Absolute humidity indicates the amount of water vapor in grams per cubic meter of air (g/m³). Unlike relative humidity, it tells the actual amount of water vapor in the air.\n\nMeasuring absolute humidity is important in environments where temperature varies greatly and moisture control is critical. Accurate moisture readings benefit industries like manufacturing and storage by helping to prevent spoilage or degradation. At home, understanding actual moisture load helps determine when a humidifier, dehumidifier, or improved ventilation is needed.\n\nAbsolute humidity is most informative when viewed over time or alongside temperature and relative humidity. It helps identify conditions where air may feel dry despite moderate relative humidity — or the opposite.\n\nSince comfort and air quality issues often relate more closely to the actual water content in the air than to percentage-based values, tracking this metric can reveal hidden indoor air balance trends that may be missed by relying solely on relative humidity.</string>
    <string name="description_text_humidity_dewpoint">The dew point is the temperature at which water vapor condenses (dew forms), and it is measured in °C, °F, or K.\n\nDew point temperature directly indicates the risk of condensation and significantly affects indoor comfort. A higher dew point means more moisture in the air, often leading to a humid or stuffy indoor environment. A low dew point indicates drier air.\n\nCondensation on surfaces occurs when air cools to its dew point. This is a major concern for preventing mold growth, corrosion, and water damage in both residential and commercial spaces. If the temperature of a window or wall drops to or below the dew point, moisture condenses on the surface and may cause damage over time.\n\nDew point values change more slowly than relative humidity, making them a reliable indicator for identifying ventilation issues or sources of excess indoor moisture.\n\nBy monitoring the dew point together with absolute and relative humidity, you gain a more complete picture of humidity dynamics in real time. This helps protect your home\'s structure, furnishings, and electronics while improving indoor air quality.</string>
    <string name="description_text_humidity_relative">Relative humidity (RH %) indicates how much moisture is in the air compared to the maximum amount the air can hold at a given temperature.\n\nA balanced humidity level at home (ideally 30–50%) makes indoor air healthier. Too much humidity promotes mold and dust mites, while too little dries out the skin and respiratory system.\n\nHumidity levels can vary between rooms and at different times of the day. Bathrooms and kitchens often show higher readings after showers or cooking. Place the sensor in the room you are most concerned about and track values over time to recognize recurring situations and take steps to avoid them.\n\nYou can manage humidity by adjusting indoor temperature and ventilating at times when outdoor humidity is lower than indoors. Once you learn to control indoor humidity, it is easier to maintain healthy air quality and also prevent potential moisture damage.\n\nRelative humidity (%) is the most commonly used unit, but you can also choose absolute humidity or dew point in the app settings.\n\nOptimal range: 40–80%\nSensor measurement range: 0–100%\n\nFor ideas on suitable alert limits, see Ruuvi’s use case examples: [link url=\"https://ruuvi.com/ideas/\"]ruuvi.com/ideas[/link]</string>

    <string name="description_text_movement">The movement counter displays movements detected via changes in the accelerometer.\n\nMonitoring the device’s motion activity indicates whether it has been moved or if its surroundings have been disturbed.\n\nNote that more events than expected may be recorded in unstable placements, such as on window sills.</string>
    <string name="description_text_nox">The NOx index indicates how much nitrogen oxides are in the air.\n\nThese are harmful gases produced, for example, by traffic exhaust, gas stoves, fireplaces, or some heating devices. Even small amounts can irritate the respiratory tract, worsen asthma, and increase susceptibility to infections. Long-term exposure can also affect the lungs and heart.\n\nThe NOx index does not provide exact concentrations but shows a trend: whether air quality has improved or worsened compared to before. For example, during cooking or when outdoor pollution increases, the value can rise quickly.\n\nThe sensor works best when it is not placed directly next to stoves or ventilation outlets.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a 24-hour average of 25 µg/m³ for nitrogen dioxide (NO₂).\n\nSensor measurement range: 0 – 500</string>
    <string name="description_text_pm">Particulate matter (PM) refers to tiny, invisible particles in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and other pollutants. Very small particles (PM2.5 and smaller) are harmful to health because they can reach deep into the lungs and worsen allergies and respiratory symptoms.\n\nBy monitoring PM levels, you can detect when indoor air quality decreases, for example due to cooking, vacuuming, burning candles, or outdoor traffic pollution. This helps you react in time by ventilating or using an air purifier.\n\nPlace the sensor where it is not directly next to emission sources, such as a stove, to keep the readings reliable. It is best to interpret the measurements as trends – noticing when the values rise or fall – rather than focusing on single numbers.\n\nThe sensor provides an estimate of the amount of particles in the air. The most commonly monitored value is PM2.5. In the settings, you can also choose to display other particle sizes, such as PM1.0, PM4.0, and PM10.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a daily average PM2.5 level of 15 μg/m³. This guideline applies to outdoor air but also serves as a benchmark for improving indoor air quality.\n\nSensor measurement range: 0 – 1000</string>
    <string name="description_text_pressure">Barometric pressure (Pa, hPa, mmHg, inHg) indicates the pressure exerted by the weight of air at a specific location — essentially, how much the atmosphere is pressing down on the Earth\'s surface at that moment.\n\nMonitoring air pressure helps anticipate weather changes and understand ventilation dynamics, which can affect building integrity and indoor comfort.\n\nTo ensure the best accuracy, do not place the sensor directly in airflow, such as near fans, ventilation vents, or open windows, as these can temporarily affect the readings.\n\nThe altitude of the measurement location above sea level influences the pressure value and, consequently, the measurement results. Air pressure at sea level is 1013.25 hectopascals (hPa).\n\nSensor measurement range: 500–1155 hPa</string>
    <string name="description_text_signal_strength">Signal strength (RSSI) indicates the quality of the Bluetooth connection. The stronger the signal (closer to 0 dBm), the more reliably sensor data is updated on the receiving device. If the signal is weak, the connection may drop or be lost entirely, causing measurement data to stop updating.\n\nConnection quality can be affected by the distance between the sensor and the receiving device, walls and other obstacles, as well as interference from household electronics.\n\nMonitoring signal strength helps you place the sensor in an optimal location. If the signal is weak, you can improve the connection by moving the sensor so it has a clearer line of sight to the receiving device. This ensures measurement data is shown reliably in the app.\n\nOptimal result: -60 – 0\nSensor measurement range: -100 – 0</string>

    <string name="description_text_temperature_celsius">The temperature sensor measures the ambient air temperature.\n\nAt home, temperature significantly affects comfort, sleep quality, concentration, and overall health. Monitoring temperature also helps optimize energy costs and improve living comfort.\n\nIndoors, place the sensor at eye level, away from surfaces or objects that conduct heat or cold, and from drafty areas.\n\nIdeally, install the sensor upright so that air can flow freely around it. For outdoor use (RuuviTag/RuuviTag Pro), place the sensor in the shade and protect it from direct rain.\n\nNote: Although the sensor detects and reports temperature changes very quickly, it may take up to an hour to fully reach thermal equilibrium with the surrounding environment.

    <string name="description_text_voc">The VOC index gives a single number showing how much volatile chemicals are in the air.\n\nThe index mimics the human sense of smell by indicating the relative intensity of odors and also detects odorless VOCs, though it cannot distinguish between them.\n\nThese chemicals can be released from many everyday products, such as cleaning agents, paints, furniture, and even some common household appliances. When VOC levels are too high, they may cause eye, nose, or throat irritation, headaches, and long-term health risks.\n\nVOC values can vary throughout the day. For example, cleaning, painting, or bringing in new furniture can cause levels to rise quickly.\n\nThe best approach is to monitor measurements over several days and take note of activities at home when values change. This helps identify where pollutants are coming from.\n\nIf VOC levels rise, ventilate the room, use an air purifier, or choose products with fewer chemicals. This helps keep indoor air healthy.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a maximum indoor level of 0.05 mg/m³ (or 0.05 ppm) for total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs).\n\nSensor measurement range: 0 – 500</string>
