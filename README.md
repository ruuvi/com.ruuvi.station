# Android_RuuvitagScannner

Android - Ruuvitag scanner, datalogger/sender

In this project we (Centria University of Applied Sciences / R&D) created Ruuvitags scanner for Android devices (supporting OS version 4.4.2 and later). This application scans for beacons around that have Eddystone URL starting with "https://ruu.vi/#" and displays them on screen (with their sensor data). To scan beacons application uses alt-beacon library and is written entirely as native Android application.

We use this in research, to monitor environment within buildings and outside.
